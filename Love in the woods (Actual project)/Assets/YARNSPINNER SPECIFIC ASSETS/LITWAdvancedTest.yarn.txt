Oh it's you.
Hey did you know that space is full of tons of things
that could destroy the earth in seconds?
One of the millions of asteroids could hit us
Or the sun could spontaneously explode
A supernova could happen near us
A black hole light years away could expel a gamma ray beam
That could just happen to be in our direction
And fry our entire solar system instantly?
